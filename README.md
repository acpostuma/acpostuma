Hi, I'm Alicia.
I'm an undergrad studying physics at Mount Allison University, and doing research with the A2 Collaboration.
My Honours thesis is on simuating the ACTAM TPC. My simulations for this project are stored in my A2Geant4 (master), acqu (tpc), and a2GoAT (tpc). Documentation of this code is stored in A2Geant4/docs/ACTAM-01-22.pdf.
You can reach me at acpostuma@mta.ca
