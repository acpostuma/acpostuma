Hi, I'm Alicia.
I'm a grad student studying subatomic particle physics at the University of Regina, and doing research with Jefferson Lab Hall C. You can reach me at acp548@uregina.

My current project is a Beam Spin Asymmetry analysis for pion production data from the KaonLT experiment. My code for this project is in the LTSep_Analysis_2022 branch of hallc_replay_lt, and will be added soon to UTIL_KAONLT.

My Honours thesis was with the A2 Collaboration and Mount Allison University, in which I wrote a Geant4 simulation of an active target known as the ACTAM TPC. My simulations for this project are stored in my A2Geant4 (master), acqu (tpc), and a2GoAT (tpc). Documentation of this code is stored in A2Geant4/docs/ACTAM-01-22.pdf.
